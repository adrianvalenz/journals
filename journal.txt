My @abu passed away today. This morning. She was alone.
Her heart was racing and she couldn't get any air. I wonder how scared she was,
if at all. She called a nurse to help. They tried to do CPR on her, but they
couldn't save her. It hurts me to think she was frightened. No one expected it
because she was doing better. 

I got a call in the morning from Javaneh, my cousin. It's like I knew what she
was going to say. She never really calls me and it was an odd time to call as
well. She asked if I had heard about Abu from my @mom. I said no. She said to
call my mom and then tell @alex and @danny. My heart started racing. I told
@torrie that I think my grandma passed away. We went to my house to be with my
mom. She wasn't home though. Danny was just waking up. I had two missed calls
from Alex...and after I tried calling him back I called my mom. My mom
confirmed what had happened to my grandma. My mom's voice started to break. I
told her I was sorry and where was she. She said she was with my @abuelito at
the care home center. She needed us to pick up her van so the plan was that
Alex and @nikki were gonna take Danny to drive the van over from Oakley School.

Torrie, @minnie, and I when to the care home center where my mom and @uncleglen
were keeping my grandpa company. It was very sad seeing my family in pain.

I went up to my grandpa. He said, "She left. Oh well"...I responded, "Yea, she
did." I asked him what he was feeling or what he thought. He responded, "I
don't believe it". :(

Later on...I was sitting with my grandpa. He started to talk to me. Only
Torrie, Nikki, and Alex were around. My grandpa started to speak so I got near
him. He said, "What am I going to do know? I am without my wife." He said he
lost everything. His eyes stared right at me. I saw the pain. Oh my grandpa, my
grandma. We miss her. I didn't know what to say, and we just looked at each
other...then he grabs my goatee and says "My precious grandson." Torrie teared
up. I asked him...what are you thinking? He said "I'm just trying to figure out
what I am going to do now? What do you advice I do" I replied, "Just continue..."
It was the first thing that came to my mind. Where he responded, "Continue, for 
what?" I said c'mon grandpa. "You have us, your family, we have each other still". 
He said, "I lost everything", I replied, "No." and asks, "No?"...at that point I 
look down wondering if I said the right thing relative to what he was feeling.

Later we were sitting in the sun. Torrie reminded me of what I told her about
her dad when he passed away. That people transform. I began to think that I
should say something to my grandpan just in case no one else did. So I switched
to another chair and sat right in front of him looking at him. Torrie and
Minnie was to my left and Alex to my right. My grandpa looks at me and says how
much he appreciates we are there with him right now. I held his hand. 
I began to tell my grandpa. "Do you know what I believe?" He looks up to me and 
asks what is that? "I believe when a person passes, when I person dies, their 
spirit lives on. The spirit of a person never dies, it cannot be destroyed. 
People transform after death. You know how my grandma loved to plant in the garden. 
Think of it like this, whenever you feel the breeze, it is her breathing. 
When you feel the warmth of the sun, it is her hugging you. When you hear the 
trees and leaves rustling, think of it as her speaking to you. 
She has transformed, but her spirit lives on."

My grandpa nodded at closed his eyes, and we were quiet for a while.
