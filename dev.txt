2016-10-17 09:00 Hello Work Journal.

This is my work journal. Where I plan to write about my advances and progess in
design and development.

I shall document my journey in programming, devops, and more.

2016-10-17 09:00 Flask or Django for my personal site.

I'm in the process of rebuilding my site again for maybe the 20th in the last
10 years. I'm trying to decide between Django and Flask, both Python based.

I remember back in the year 2005 or so, I wanted to create a custom website for
my artwork. I did a lot of charcoal drawings and acrylic paintings. I would
look for hosted and self-hosted solutions.

I remember using Microsoft FrontPage express to create HTML pages with effects
and it wrote the CSS for me. I used to upload the files to GeoCities to host my
website online.

Later I wanted a more mature, well-featured solution. So I would look for
hosted solutions on line. I remember signing up for websites with portfolio and
blog like features, themes you can click to activate. It was cool stuff. But I
wanted ultimate control. I think that is how I got into Web Development. But it
was a long process because I didn't have any real guidance in that industry,
plus I think I was distracted as a youngen.
